Problem set 1.

Immigrants, refugees and refugee claimants make 40 percent of people using shelters in the city of Toronto that also identify as homeless. (Teresa, 2019). With the public’s growing concerns on why the government of Canada is delaying to declare homelessness as a state of emergency (PressProgress, 2019), one of the homeless shelter’s greatest threats is capacity. Using the daily shelter occupancy dataset from the city of Toronto’s Open Data portal, a study of the dataset will be provided to explore the Question of Which shelter sector (male/female/Co-ed/families/youth) has the highest occupancy?

Problem set 2.

We use Apartment Building Evaluation dataset from Toronto’s Open Data Portal (Sharla, 2019) to analyze the security levels of various property types in Toronto from 2017 to 2019. Using R programming (R Core Team,2019) we find that buildings owned privately have better security conditions compared to social housing or Toronto Community Housing Corporation. Our findings identify opportunities for social housing providers and the Toronto Community Housing Corporation to improve their security conditions in the
future.It additionally provides further clarity to renters in terms of which type of property they should look into.
