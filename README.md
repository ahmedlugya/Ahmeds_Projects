Problem set 1.

Immigrants, refugees and refugee claimants make 40 percent of people using shelters in the city of Toronto that also identify as homeless. (Teresa, 2019). With the public’s growing concerns on why the government of Canada is delaying to declare homelessness as a state of emergency (PressProgress, 2019), one of the homeless shelter’s greatest threats is capacity. Using the daily shelter occupancy dataset from the city of Toronto’s Open Data portal, a study of the dataset will be provided to explore the Question of Which shelter sector (male/female/Co-ed/families/youth) has the highest occupancy?

Problem set 2.

We use Apartment Building Evaluation dataset from Toronto’s Open Data Portal (Sharla, 2019) to analyze the security levels of various property types in Toronto from 2017 to 2019. Using R programming (R Core Team,2019) we find that buildings owned privately have better security conditions compared to social housing or Toronto Community Housing Corporation. Our findings identify opportunities for social housing providers and the Toronto Community Housing Corporation to improve their security conditions in the
future.It additionally provides further clarity to renters in terms of which type of property they should look into.

Problem set 3.

We use Catalogue Quality Scores dataset from Toronto’s Open Data Portal to analyze the relationship between the quality score of datasets on the city of Toronto’s open data portal and their metadata. The importance behind this analysis is that although more of the data is being published in various formats, data analysts, scientists, and students are on numerous occasions left with a time consuming and challenging task of identifying relevant data and understanding this data before any analysis can be done. Therefore it is necessary to publish datasets with satisfactory metadata to aid the usability of the datasets. We identified that as the quality score of the datasets increases, its metadata increases.

Problem set 4.

We use Kid Creative dataset (StatsProf,2012) to analyze the relationship between having a college degree and sales of parenting magazines. We analyze other affecting factors such as Race and use Matching algorithms to observe how much impact having a college degree had on the purchase of parenting magazines. The purpose of this analysis is to help companies determine the type of magazine Ads that should be portrayed to customers. We identify that holding or not holding a college degree has a great impact on the purchase of parenting magazines.
